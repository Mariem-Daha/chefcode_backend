# OCR Functionality Removed

## Date: October 21, 2025

The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionality has been completely removed from the ChefCode backend.

## Files Deleted:
- ✅ `Backend/routes/ocr.py` - OCR API endpoints
- ✅ `Backend/tools/ocr_invoice.py` - Invoice OCR processing logic
- ✅ `Backend/google-service-account.json` - Google Cloud credentials
- ✅ `Backend/OCR_SETUP.md` - OCR setup documentation
- ✅ `Backend/OCR_QUICK_SETUP.md` - Quick setup guide

## Files Modified:
- ✅ `Backend/main.py` - Removed OCR router import and registration
- ✅ `Backend/requirements.txt` - Removed OCR dependencies:
  - `google-cloud-documentai`
  - `google-api-core`
  - `google-generativeai`
  - `pillow`
- ✅ `Backend/.env` - Removed OCR configuration variables:
  - `PROJECT_ID`
  - `LOCATION`
  - `PROCESSOR_ID`
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
  - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

## Frontend Status:
✅ **Frontend OCR UI remains intact** - The upload button and OCR modal are still in the frontend.
   - When users try to use OCR, they will get a "404 Not Found" error
   - The frontend gracefully handles this and shows an error message
   - Users can still use the AI Assistant (voice/text) as an alternative

## Backend Status:
✅ **Backend running without OCR:**
- Server: http://localhost:8000
- Health: ✅ Healthy
- OCR endpoints: ❌ Not Found (404)
- All other features: ✅ Working

## Alternative Solutions:
Users can still add inventory items using:
1. **AI Assistant** - Voice commands or text chat (recommended)
2. **Manual Input** - Standard form entry
3. **Web Recipe Search** - Import from online recipes

## Why OCR Was Removed:
Per user request - to remove all OCR code from the backend while keeping the frontend interface intact.

**Note:** If you want to re-enable OCR in the future, you'll need to:
1. Restore the deleted files from version control
2. Reinstall OCR dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Configure Google Cloud credentials
4. Add OCR router back to `main.py`
